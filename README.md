This is a full-stack web application project for a startup called Yelp Camp.
It is a web application designed to add, rate and review different campgrounds,
different users(read campers) can put in their comments and concerns, 
so that it is a well informed and well prepared camping trip for other users.
This project is from the web developer bootcamp from Colt Steele.
